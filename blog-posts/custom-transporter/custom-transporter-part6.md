### Introduction

This is Part 6 of a six-part series.  If you landed here from Google, you may want to start with [Part 1](https://dev.to/nestjs/part-1-introduction-and-setup-1a2l).

In this article, we build the final iteration of the server component of our Faye Custom Transporter.

**Reminder**: Many of the concepts and terminology here are introduced and explained in [this article series](https://dev.to/nestjs/integrate-nestjs-with-external-services-using-microservice-transporters-part-1-p3). That series serves as a good foundation for understanding the more advanced concepts covered in this series.

#### Get the Code

All of the code in these articles is available [here](xxx).  As always, these tutorials work best if you follow along with the code.  The [README](xxx) covers all the steps you need to get the repository, build the apps, and follow along.  It's easy!  I strongly encourage you to do so.  Note that each article has a corresponding branch in the repository.  For example, this article (Part 3), has a corresponding branch called `part3`. Read on, or [get more details here](xxx) on using the repository.

#### Git checkout the current version

For this article, you should `git checkout` the branch `part3`.  You can get more information [about the git repository branches here](xxx).

#### Build the Apps for This Part

For each article in the series, we introduce some new components (and sometimes entirely new **projects**).  For convenience, at the start of each article, you should run the following command from the top-level directory (where you cloned the repo): \*

```bash
$ sh build.sh
```
\**This is a bash script that runs on Linux-like systems.  You may have to make an adjustment for non-Linux systems.  Note that the script is simply a convenience that runs `npm install && npm run build`inside each top-level directory, so you can always fall back to that technique if you have trouble with the script.*
