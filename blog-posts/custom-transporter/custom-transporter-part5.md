### Introduction

This is part 5 of a six-part series.  If you landed here from Google, you may want to start with [part 1](https://dev.to/nestjs/build-a-custom-transporter-for-nestjs-microservices-dc6-temp-slug-6007254?preview=d3e07087758ff2aac037f47fb67ad5b465f45272f9c5c9385037816b139cf1ed089616c711ed6452184f7fb913aed70028a73e14fef8e3e41ee7c3fc#requestresponse).

In this article, we build the final iteration of the client component of the Faye Custom Transporter.

**Reminder**: Many of the concepts and terminology here are introduced and explained in [this article series](https://dev.to/nestjs/integrate-nestjs-with-external-services-using-microservice-transporters-part-1-p3). That series serves as a good foundation for understanding the more advanced concepts covered in this series.

#### Get the Code

All of the code in these articles is available [here](https://github.com/johnbiundo/nestjs-faye-transporter-sample).  As always, these tutorials work best if you follow along with the code.  The [README](https://github.com/johnbiundo/nestjs-faye-transporter-sample/blob/master/README.md) covers all the steps you need to get the repository, build the apps, and follow along.  It's easy!  I strongly encourage you to do so.  Note that each article has a corresponding branch in the repository.  For example, this article (part 5), has a corresponding branch called `part5`. Read on, or [get more details here](https://github.com/johnbiundo/nestjs-faye-transporter-sample/blob/master/README.md#part-5-final-client-component) on using the repository.

#### Git checkout the current version

For this article, you should `git checkout` the branch `part4`.  You can get more information [about the git repository branches here](https://github.com/johnbiundo/nestjs-faye-transporter-sample/blob/master/README.md#part-5-final-client-component).

#### Build the Apps for This Part

For each article in the series, we introduce some new components (and sometimes entirely new **projects**).  For convenience, at the start of each article, you should run the command\*

```bash
$ # from root directory of project (e.g., transporter-tutorial, or whatever you chose as the root)
$ sh build.sh
```
\**This is a shell script that runs on Linux-like systems.  You may have to make an adjustment for non-Linux systems.  Note that the script is simply a convenience that runs `npm install` inside each top-level directory, so you can always fall back to that technique if you have trouble with the script.*

### Overview

I ended the last article with a discussion of the shortcomings of our *Take 1* (first iteration) implementation of the Faye Custom Transporter client component.  In this article, we'll address those shortcomings.
